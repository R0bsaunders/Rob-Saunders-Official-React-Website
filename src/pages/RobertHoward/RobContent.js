This is one less step for a user, saving them time searching for their language. However, the limitation I have is that this button can ONLY be placed on the page of the website (below the main navigation). This is because Squarespace does not currently offer the ability to insert 'Custom Code' into the header navigation of its websites. This means we will have to put this button somewhere on all the pages we want to offer translation on.",

        p: `This is another automatic translation service but is directly integrated with Squarespace. The advantage is that it appears in the website's main navigation as pictured on the right (again if your screen is wide enough). The main disadvantage is that it is only free for up to 2,000 words, after that it costs €150 per year (or €15 billed monthly) for up to 10,000 words, but I wonder if it's worth it in the long run - especially taking into consideration that this is also automatic translation.`,

        p: `If you want the ability to add 'perfectly' translated French content, as well as rank in French Search Engines, I think it would be best to buy a second domain name i.e. "www.robert-howard.fr" and have a second site in Squarespace. Unfortunately, Squarespace will see this as a separate site and charge a second hosting fee. However, the main advantages here are 1) You can manually add your own translated text to the website. 2) It will be recognised as a French website due to the domain ending with 'fr'. 3) You will be able to conduct SEO on the website specifically for the French. I realised that while I have the tools to do this for English websites targeting those in the UK, I am not fluent in French and I wouldn't be best suited to try and establish what the French are searching for. The tool I use allows me to check French keywords, so if you do use me for ongoing SEO, you could give me keywords in French, and I'll report back how popular they are etc, and then you could add them to your French content. This French duplicate can be done at a further date so you don't have to decide now. If you did want to do this at some stage I can just set it up for you and bill for my time (it won't be very long).`,
