        aboutP: "Since completing a bootcamp in Front-End Development, which focussed on CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Node.js and React.js, I have become passionate about coding, programming, and logic. In the months following graduation my desire to make coding my future career has grown exponentially. I enrolled in the 16-week bootcamp because it is my goal to make this my caree. I attendeded ALL evening lessons on Zoom and spent an additional circa 20 hours per week to complete every mandatory assignment. All of this on top of my full-time Mon-Fri 8am-5pm (plus 6 hours travel) job! Since the course ended in March 2023, I have dedicated much time to continuing to progress my development skills and have created several of my own projects using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and React.js to prove my desire to change my career into front end development is as real as laws of physics!",

        aboutP2: "Described as ‘contagiously enthusiastic’ by my friends and colleagues, I am a lover of the great outdoors, and have a hunger to develop my front-end (and programming) web development skills. I often push myself to the limit on the trail, walking long distances over a few days and including wild camping. I am teaching myself to play the piano and have regular singing lessons. I do all these things because I believe life is not about following the norm, or for sitting down slave to the media, but is about exploring, learning and discovery! I am interested in science, religion, space, tech...the list is endless.",
       
        aboutP3: "I achieve what I put my mind to and can persevere through uncertainty; not being afraid to put in hard-work and dedication to understand and achieve the desired outcomes. I am a firm believer that when we take ourselves out of our comfort zones we begin to grow, strengthen ourselves and truly define our identity and character! So, what appeals most to me about coding? It is the liberation, infinite possibility and endless problem-solving that requires knowledge, research, and a huge amount of imagination to solve. It is liberating because I can do it on any 'corner' of the globe. It is full of problems to solve which keeps my hyperactive brain focussed on problem-solving. The dopamine hit from ironing out a bug 'ripple' and seeing the code run flawlessly, for me, is heaven!!! And the imagination use? Well, there are an infinite number of solutions to an equal number of problems, so thinking outside the box is required. Coding calms me, makes me happy, instils a sense of fulfilment in me and it's as clear to me as the sky on a starry night that this is my future!"
