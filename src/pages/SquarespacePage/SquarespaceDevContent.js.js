        p: "Squarespace is a great-value website-building tool that can be used by small businesses to quickly create and maintain a professional online presence. It has a library of beautifully designed website templates to choose from (which can be modified to include client brand colours and content) so that visually appealing websites can be constructed at a fraction of the cost of a bespoke design agency. It boasts a wide range of features including website analytics, e-commerce capabilities, and search engine optimization tools. For simple websites and online shops, I use Squarespace because it keeps time, therefore costs, to a minimum, whilst balancing simplicity, quality, and functionality.",

        p: "The Squarespace website design platform is a solid foundation for your website. It offers just the right amount of customisation and functionality that small businesses need without sacrificing reliability. While a Squarespace website designer must keep to the parameters of its system, a Squarespace website very rarely breaks or stops working - something clients can feel reassured about when making their changes or updates to their website. I recommend using a Squarespace website design not only to keep costs down but also because its drag-and-drop design content management system also means that my clients require very little (if any) website knowledge to keep their website updated.",

        p: `Squarespace web designer pricing is affordable, and worth it! My Squarespace website design cost starts at £600. This includes a homepage, a contact page, up to 10 service pages and an about page. I can then price up any additional requirements like content writing, search engine optimisation work, online shopping etc. Squarespace has a modest ongoing hosting charge which I make clear in the proposal I send you. Unlike some web agencies who uplift their costs by two or three times (if not more) and then invoice their clients, I on the other hand ask that my clients pay Squarespace directly for their website hosting which involves nothing more than registering their card details in their Squarespace account. For this reason, there are no uplifts in cost - just another way I help small businesses reduce their website costs.`,

        p: "Once the new website is launched, there isn't much else Squarespace web designers need to do. However, most clients want to add content, change or add pictures, and update, remove, and add new products to their website. I build all my Squarespace websites so that my clients can do this themselves however, some prefer me to do it for them as it is just one less thing to worry about. My ongoing support fee starts at just £50 per month to include some minor changes and help. I have more comprehensive support packages available where required but suffice to say, they are very reasonable.",
